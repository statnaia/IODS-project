# In the BPRS data 40 male subjects were randomly assigned to one of two treatment groups 
# and each subject was rated on the brief psychiatric rating scale (BPRS) measured before treatment began (week 0) 
# and then at weekly intervals for eight weeks. The BPRS assesses the level of 18 symptom constructs such as hostility, 
# suspiciousness, hallucinations and grandiosity; each of these is rated from one (not present) to seven (extremely severe). 
# The scale is used to evaluate patients suspected of having schizophrenia.
